# Release Notes â€“ 0.4.0
**Summary:** Sprint 4 delivers a complete round experience: end-of-round summary with percent and restart, local history of recent games, difficulty selector controlling answer options, and deterministic shuffling when seeded. E2E tests now cover summary, history, difficulty, and randomisation flows.

**Highlights**
- Round summary with % correct and restart
- Recent game history (localStorage, last 5)
- Difficulty selector (4/6/8 options) via `?options=`
- Deterministic option shuffle when seeded; varied order without seed

**Breaking changes:** None
