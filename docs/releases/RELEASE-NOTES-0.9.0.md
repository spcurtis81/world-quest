# World Quest â€” Release Notes 0.9.0 (planned)

This release focuses on UX polish and design readiness to prepare for visual refinement in upcoming sprints.

Highlights:
- Region-change modal refined: portaled to `document.body`, deterministic background blocking via `inert`, ESC/cancel/confirm flows, and subtle entrance animation
- Toast notifications for key events (e.g., starting a new round)
- Mobile refinements for spacing and tap targets
- Accessibility smoke checks (dev-only via axe) to catch obvious issues early
- Shared design tokens (`tokens.css`) for colors, spacing, radii, and shadows, ready for broader adoption

No breaking API changes.
